the United States spends more money on

education than any other country in the

world and yet we get the worst outcomes

we're at the bottom of every list in

total American society pours more than a

trillion dollars a year into public

education systems

but instead of being at the top of the

list we are literally right smack

Guess what at the bottom rather than

indoctrinating young people with

inappropriate racial sexual and

political material which is what we're

doing now our schools must be totally

refocused to prepare our children to

succeed in the world

of work and in life and the world of

keeping our country strong so they can

grow up to be happy prosperous and

independent citizens we owe our children

great schools that lead to great jobs

and leads to an even greater country

that we're living in right now right now

we're living in a failing Nation because

of Joe Biden and these people running it

their marxists their Communists what

they're doing to our country is

incredible but we'll take care of that

for our children

here are 10 key ideas that will power

our movement for Great Schools first we

will respect the right of parents to

control the education of their children

second we will Empower parents and local

school board to hire and reward great

principals and teachers and also to fire

the poor ones the one whose performances

unsatisfactory they will be fired like

on The Apprentice you're fired third we

will ensure our classrooms are focused

not on political indoctrination but on

teaching the knowledge and skills needed

to succeed Reading Writing math science

arithmetic and other truly useful

subjects fourth we will teach students

to love their country not to hate their

country like they're taught right now

fifth we will support bringing back

prayer to our schools sixth we will

achieve schools that are safe secure and

drug free with immediate expulsion for

any student who harms a teacher or

another student seventh we will give all

parents the right to choose another

school for their children if they want

school school choice eighth we will

ensure students have access to

project-based learning experiences

inside the classroom to help train them

for Meaningful work outside the

classroom night we will strive to give

all students access to internships and

work experiences that can set them on a

path to their first job they're going to

be very very successful I want them to

be more successful than Trump let them

go out and be more successful I will be

the happiest person in the world but we

want our children to have a great life

and be successful in 10th we will ensure

that all schools provide excellent jobs

and career counseling so that high

school and college students can get a

head start on jobs and careers best

suited to their god-given talents this

is how we will ensure a great education

for every American child and one other

thing I'll be doing very early in the

administration is closing up the

Department of Education in Washington

D.C and sending all education and

education work and needs back to the

States we want them to run the education

of our children because they'll do a

much better job of it you can't do worse

we spend more money per pupil by three

times than any other nation and yet

we're absolutely at the bottom we're one

of the worst

so you can't do worse we're going to end

education coming out of Washington D.C

we're going to close it up all those

buildings all over the place and you

have people that in many cases hate our

children we're going to send it all back

to the States thank you very much
